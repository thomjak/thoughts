Here we go. I have created a blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Anatole theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/anatole/). I'm hosting the site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) ðŸŽ‰

It has been a pretty smooth experience so far. Maybe I'll share some more details and thoughts in a later post ðŸš€

My goal with this blog is to practice writing to better internalize and remember the knowledge I learn. This will also get its own post later on ðŸ˜„
