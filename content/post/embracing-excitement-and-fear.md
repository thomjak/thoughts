Lately, I've noticed that I often struggle to get started on new things. My mind tends to come up with lazy excuses such as:

- I'm not capable of doing this
- It's too difficult
- It's too time-consuming
- Other, better developers do stuff like this

More often than not, these aren't rational thoughts. Recently, I've adopted a new perspective on these mental blocks.

**Embracing Excitement and Fear**

Sometimes, the things that scare us the most are the ones that lead to the greatest growth. Whether it's developing a new software service, launching a project, learning something new, or stepping into the unknown, the initial fear and excitement are signs of new opportunities.



Here are two things i remind myself when I feel scared or excited about something:

1. Remember, what feels scary today will soon become the new normal. Keep pushing for those exciting/scary things because theyâ€™re the ones that help us grow the most. ðŸš€

2. Once you adopt the mindset of embracing the discomfort of stepping out of your comfort zone, you'll realize that the more you do, the more capable you become. ðŸš€
